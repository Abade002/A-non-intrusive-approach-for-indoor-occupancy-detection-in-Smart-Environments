# A-non-intrusive-approach-for-indoor-occupancy-detection-in-Smart-Environments

## Abstract

Smart Environments try to adapt their conditions focusing on the detection, localization, and identification of people on them to improve their comfort. Thus, it is common to use in this kind of environment different environmental sensors, actuators, and analytics techniques to process data from the surrounding and actuate accordingly. 

In this research, a solution to improve the user's experience in Smart Environments based on information obtained, specifically from indoor locations, following a non-intrusive approach is proposed. The analytics performed in the solution uses Machine Learning techniques to determine occupants and estimate the number of persons in a specific indoor area. The solution was tested in a real scenario using a prototype system, integrated by nodes and sensors, specifically designed and developed to gather the environmental data of interest. 

The results obtained demonstrate that with the developed system, it is possible to obtain, process and store environmental information. Additionally, the analysis performed over the gathered data using Machine Learning and pattern recognition mechanisms depicts that it is possible to determine the occupancy of indoor environments.

Some of the Machine Learning code was developed and adapted during the Machine Learning by Coursera from Prof. Dr. Andrew Ng.
